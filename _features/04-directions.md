<h3>BART</h3>
<p>UC Berkeley campus is just one block from the downtown Berkeley BART Station. From the station, walk east on Addison Street or Center Street until you get to Oxford Street. When you enter the West Circle entrance of the campus, follow Univeristy Drive up the hill. You will see Doe library on your right when you reach Memorial Glade. Ask the kiosk attendant if you need help finding your way.</p>
<h3>Parking On/Near Campus</h3>
<p>Metered parking is available off campus on Oxford Street and at the parking structure on Addison Street.</p>
<p>If you have arranged for a parking permit, you can pick it up at the parking kiosk at the West Circle entrance off Oxford St. DO NOT park on campus in a designated permit-only spot unless you have a parking permit for that area; parking is enforced 24 hours a day seven days a week on the UC Berkeley campus.</p>
<p>See the <a href="http://pt.berkeley.edu/">UC parking and transportation</a> site for campus parking areas and required permits.</p>
