Following the success of [last year's ImageXD meeting at
BIDS](http://www.imagexd.org/2016/06/21/inaugural-workshop.html), we are
organizing a second workshop at the [University of Washington eScience Institute](http://escience.washington.edu)
in March 2017.

The workshop will follow the three-day format of the workshop from last year
with each day focused on a different activity:

### Learn

On Day 1, the [scikit-image team](http://scikit-image.org/) will lead a
technical workshop introducing methods in Python to analyze image data.

This year, we are planning to accomodate participants with diverse backgrounds,
by offering two tracks in this day. This will also allow us to cover additional
topics, including image processing with artificial neural networks using
[TensorFlow](tensorflow.org).

### Discuss

On Day 2, selected speakers will share their expertise.
