Following the success of [last year's ImageXD meeting at
BIDS](http://www.imagexd.org/2016/06/21/inaugural-workshop.html), we are
organizing a second workshop at the University of Washington eScience Institute
in March 2017.

The workshop will follow the three-day format of the workshop from last year
with each day focused on a different activity:

### Learn

On Day 1, the [scikit-image team](http://scikit-image.org/) will lead a
technical workshop introducing methods in Python to analyze image data.

This year, we are planning to accomodate participants with diverse backgrounds,
by offering two tracks in this day. This will also allow us to cover additional
topics, including image processing with artificial neural networks using
[TensorFlow](tensorflow.org).

### Discuss

On Day 2, selected speakers will share their expertise.

Confirmed speakers include:

- Lydia Ng, Allen Institute for Brain Science
- Mario Juric, The University of Washington

Day 3 will also include break-out sessions, and lightning talks by participants,
to facilitate discussions, and bring up ideas for projects that can be tackled
during day 3.

### Create

On Day 3, we will get together to work in teams to develop ideas opportunities
in data, software, algorithms, and learning. This open format will allow
participants to learn from each other, work together and explore concepts that
cross domain boundaries.
