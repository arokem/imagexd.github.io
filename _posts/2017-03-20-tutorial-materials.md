## Data

We will be using a data-set of cell images kindly provided by Maryana Alegro (UCSF). The data is available to download [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/cells.tar.gz).


## Software

We will be using Keras and TensorFlow.

First install Tensorflow. Follow the instructions provide [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) for your platform. Once you have completed that, please type `pip install keras`. Depending on your setup, this last command may have to be executed under `sudo` (that is, `sudo pip install keras`)

Materials for the keras tutorial are available [here](https://github.com/arokem/keras-tutorial).
